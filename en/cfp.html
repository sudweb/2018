        <p>This year, the call for proposals concerns all interventions at Sud-Web 2018.</p>
        <p>There will still be a form of curation, but all subjects will go through this form so that the team can choose the programming in a concerted way.</p>
        <p>All forms of talks are possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>talk with visual support(s);</li>
          <li><abbr lang="en">lighting talk</abbr> ;</li>
          <li>stand-up ;</li>
          <li>group activities…</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not want you to feel trapped in the elaboration of a "traditional" talk. Let's find formats that make sense with which you feel comfortable!</p>

        <p>Do you have one or more ideas? <a href="#form">Do not hesitate, you have until:
           <strong>Feburary 16, 2018</strong> (11:59 pm, Paris Time)
           to propose a talk</a>.</p>

        <p>We remind you that we'll favour:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>experience</strong> feedbacks ;</li>
          <li>what make <strong>sense</strong> in your approach ;</li>
          <li>what you have learned from this experience, <strong>the lesson(s)</strong> you learned from it ;</li>
          <li>the <strong>change</strong> to be applied from the following Monday.</li>
        </ul>
